# PMR

PMR(Probabilistic two sample mendelian randomization),is an R package for efficient statistical inference of two-sample MR analysis. It can account for the correlatded instruments and the horizontal pleiotropy, and can provide the
accurate estimates of both causal effect and horizontal pleiotropy effect as well as the two corresponding p values.

# Installation
It is easy to install the development version of PMR package using the 'devtools' package. The typical install time on a "normal" desktop computer is less than one minute.

```
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("yuanzhongshang/PMR")
```


# Usage
There are two main functions in PMR package, one is *PMR_individual* for individual level data, the other is *PMR_summary_Egger* for summary data.
For PMR_indvidual, two pleiotropy model assumptions have been designed, one is the Egger assumption, the other is polygenic assumption (variance component model). 
Note that the current version of pleiotropy assumption for summary data is Egger, which has been implemented by function *PMR_summary_Egger*. 
You can find the instructions by '?PMR_individual' and '?PMR_summary_Egger'. 
```
library(PMR)

?PMR_individual

?PMR_summary_Egger
```
